			text \The story focuses on 22-year-old ex-[bōsōzoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bōsōzoku) member Eikichi Onizuka, who becomes a teacher at a private middle school, Holy Forest Academy, in [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). It won the 1998 [Kodansha Manga Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodansha_Manga_Award) for shōnen and is a continuation of Tohru Fujisawa's other manga series [Shonan Junai Gumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonan_Junai_Gumi) (lit. "Shōnan True Love Group") and Bad Company, both of which focus on the life of Onizuka before he becomes a teacher in Great Teacher Onizuka.
